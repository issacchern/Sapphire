# Description

Sapphire plugin is like a real-time recording tool for eclipse. Whatever you write or do inside eclipse, it will be recorded into a  database file. The purpose of developing this plugin is to learn about the process of how beginner students start to write code. A good analogy would be that English teacher asks students to write few drafts before submitting their essays. We want to know what kind of mistakes or struggles that students have been through to get their assignments done. We care more about what students have learned throughout the course rather than just getting a good grade. By analyzing data that we collected from students, perhaps we can find a way to improve the teaching's quality and effectiveness at UB.

# Sample Output

This plugin will create a database file in the project folder. You can view the database file by using any third party database browser or tool. I use [Database Browser Portable](http://portableapps.com/apps/development/database_browser_portable) to view the file.
