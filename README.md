# Description

This plugin is used for recording the changes that users made under JavaModel from time to time. The objective of developing this plugin is to help students in learning how to code efficiently. By analyzing the output file generated from the plugin, we can see how the students wrote the code and we will see the kind of common mistakes they made and what their struggles are while coding. Thereby, we can teach students the right way of coding and avoid making unnecessary mistakes.


NOTE: This plugin will run automatically once installed.

# Sample Output

Every Java Project will have its own recorded file. Here's a sample of recorded file.
